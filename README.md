Introduction :

Docker project on launching owncloud in my system by using docker container over rhel 8 
and u can put your gb's of data here which will be safe and secure for us and i am able to create 
this project only because of iiec_rise campaign 1.0 under the great mentor and the world 
record holder Mr.Vimal Daga https://www.linkedin.com/in/vimaldaga/ and i can not explain 
about sir in words.

And i would like to thank Mr.Vimal Daga Sir and Preeti Mam for such an great initiative iiec_rise

 I have used rhel 8(host  os) on the top of windows(base os) by virtualization using tool virtual box
 - before runnning any docker container you may need to off firewall and SELinux security 
   
   for firewall systemctl stop firewalld
   
   for SELinux  setenforce 0
